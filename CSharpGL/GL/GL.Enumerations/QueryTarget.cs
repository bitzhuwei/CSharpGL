If the value of GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 0, then the samples-passed count is incremented by 1 for each fragment. If the value of GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS is 1, then the samples-passed count is incremented by the number of samples whose coverage bit is set. However, implementations, at their discression may instead increase the samples-passed count by the value of GL_SAMPLES if any sample in the fragment is covered. When glEndQuery is executed, the samples-passed counter is assigned to the query object's result value. This value can be queried by calling glGetQueryObject with pname GL_QUERY_RESULT.
