A Buffer Object that is used to store uniform data for a shader program is called a Uniform Buffer Object. They can be used to share uniforms between different programs, as well as quickly change between sets of uniforms for the same program object. 

The term "Uniform Buffer Object" refers to the OpenGL buffer object that is used to provide storage for uniforms. The term "uniform blocks" refer to the GLSL language grouping of uniforms whose storage come from buffer objects.
